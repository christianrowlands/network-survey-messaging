// device_serial_number:      The unique identifier for the Android Phone.  This should be consistent and should never change.  A good value is the IMEI of the device.
// device_name:               A human readable identifier for the Android phone.  This value does not need to be consistent or unique.  E.g. "Bob's Phone".
// device_time:               The timestamp of when this message was created in milliseconds since unix epoch time.
// latitude:                  The latitude of where the android device is currently located.
// longitude:                 The longitude of where the android device is currently located.
// altitude:                  The altitude of the android device.
// mission_id:                A unique name for this particular run of the Survey.  The timestamp of when the survey was started is typically included.
// record_number:             Starts at 1 and each subsequent record should have its number incremented by 1.
// record_number:             Starts at 1 and each subsequent scan should have its number incremented by 1.
