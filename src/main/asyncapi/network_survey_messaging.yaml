  title: Network Survey Messaging API
  version: '0.2.0'
  description: |
    The Network Survey Messaging API defines a set of messages that can be used to describe
    wireless survey related events. The messages range from cellular surveys such as GSM, CDMA,
    UMTS, and LTE, to simple RF energy detection events.

    While the most common use of these messages would be to send to an MQTT broker, this API specification
    simply defines the message schema. The transport or storage technology employed is purposefully left
    open to allow for these messages to flow over a variety of transports such as MQTT, gRPC, AMQP, etc.
    In addition, these messages can be written to disk by writing the JSON strings directly to a file to
    support unstructured data storage, or in a more structured approach such as a PostgreSQL or SQLite database.

    Officially, the message schema support for the Network Survey Messaging API are the JSON defined messags from this
    document. However, protobuf definitions of these messages have been created as a convinence for a couple of reasons.
    First, it can make generating the JSON compliant messages easier and also converting the JSON messages to language
    specific objects. Secondly, it can allow for sending the messages in protocol buffer format instead of JSON if a
    compressed binary format is needed. It also has the side effect of supporting sending these messages over gRPC if
    Remote Procedure Call support is of interest. Check out the [Network Survey Messaging Github README](https://github.com/christianrowlands/network-survey-messaging) for more details.
